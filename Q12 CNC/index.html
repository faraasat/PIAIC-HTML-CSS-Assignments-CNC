      <p>
        The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to
        program in open source technologies like,
        <b
          >Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
          Native</b
        >
        while introducing the students to development of Microservices and
        software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS

      <span class="main-bold"><span>A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</span>
      <p>
        The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student
        through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in
        open source languages like
        <b>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</b>, and teaching
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with
        real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.

      <span class="main-bold"><span>B</span>lockchain:</span>
      <p>
        The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the
        blockchains like <b>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)</b>, and learn to
        program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like
        Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed
        Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth
        understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS) and how to develop and
        offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
